# Semantic-Segmentation
# Dataset BRaTS 21
# Monai module SegResNet model
This is an example of semantic segmentation on MRI scan. To run this code a GPU connected environment and about 25 GB of free space is required, the first cell is for all the necessary libraries need to run the code, colab usually comes with all the preinstalled libraries with compatible version, using colab is recomended. If this code is run in the local machine version compatibility with different libraries might be an issue. Cell number 8 download the entire dataset.
